This folder contains example fields and software that demonstrates
 computation of displacement of isopleths as introduced in
Melsom, A. (2021): Edge displacement scores. The Cryosphere.

This is the example that is presented and discussed in Section 2.1-2

The software produces the values that are given in Table 1, and
 the distributions that are presented in Figure 2

The software has been written in R (https://www.r-project.org/)

The library that is used for reading netCDF files is available
 from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNetCDF/index.html


N O T E !

 The software must be executed in sequence, since PART 2 depends on
 output from PART 1, and PART 3 depends on output from PART 2.


PART 1
======

Add edge node variables (no. grid nodes; x, y grid cell no)
 to the netCDF file

R CMD BATCH addEdgePos.R
 (uses function  setEdgeNodes  from  edgeNodes.R)


PART 2
======

Compute results to be listed in Table 1

2.1 Calculate edge distances; results will be stored in
     distance_all_edge[12].dat
 R CMD BATCH allDistances.R

2.2 Summarize results from 2.1 in displacement distance categories;
    results will be stored in
     distance_distro.dat
 R CMD BATCH tabulatedDistances.R


PART 3
======

Compute results to be displayed in Figure 2.
Results for Figure 2 will be stored in
 distance_ref.dat
 distance_mod.dat

R CMD BATCH edgeMotion.R
 (uses function  edgeDistro     from  IEdistance.R
   and function  allLinesPlain  from  allLinesPlain.R)

NOTE 1:  edgeMotion.R  returns additional results which are
                        not used for Figure 2
NOTE 2:  allLinesPlain which sequences edge grid nodes into line
                        segments may not work well for complex
                        configurations of edge grid nodes (sub-
			optimalsplitting of branching edge lines);
                        in that case, the user must write an
			alternative code for his/her purpose
